DON'T USE, use the latest mainline [Lokaltog/vim-easymotion][] instead, [my own
dotfiles now use EasyMotion 2.0][my own dotfiles].

[Lokaltog/vim-easymotion]: https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion
[my own dotfiles]: https://github.com/laughinghan/dotfiles/commit/33d1383dea22c13b5695e52bc392fd14f5fa88a1

EasyMotion 2.0 is so flexible, the customizations in my fork [are now config
options](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion/tree/2.0#new-feature-from-20):
- Spacebar as the EasyMotion hotkey (this might've always been a config option)
- two-character motion targets
- homerow keys for motion targets, rather than the alphabet
